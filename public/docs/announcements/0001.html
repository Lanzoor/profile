        <h2>January 16th</h2>

        <p>
            The hiatus was due to an English program being held by a university, and I was only able to use my phone for only <i>10 minutes</i> every two days or so.<br>
            I hope this explains the situation. However, some things didn't go as planned, and I got sick. I had to return home temporarily.<br>
            <b>I will be able to be active, talk on Discord, and program stuff for the next <i>two days</i>.</b> (Jan 16 ~ Jan 18, local time.)<br>
            After that, I will be <b>returning to the program as usual</b>, ending on <b>Jan 24</b>, local time.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>January 19th</h2>

        <p>
            NEVERMIND. I GOT SICK AGAIN. On the first night. So, no more hiatus. Everything's back to normal.
