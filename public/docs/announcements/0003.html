    <h1>Vacation Announcement / Diary</h1>

    <h2>January 29th</h2>

    <p>
        Starting from this Friday (January 30th, local time) to next Wednesday (February 4th), <b>I am going to be on a trip to 🇯🇵 &Omacr;saka, Japan!</b><br>
        I can't share furthermore details about the vacation due to privacy, but I will still be sending some pictures to close friends.<br>
        I will be a bit less active on Discord, and I won't be able to program during the vacation. (unless I find out a way on how to bring my ENTIRE desktop to Japan with me HAHA)<br>
        However, I will still be able to respond to anything on Discord, <b>so don't hesitate to message me meanwhile!</b> I'll make sure to post any necessary updates while I'm on the vacation.<br>
        <b>Thanks as always, and have a nice day! 👋</b> I will be sharing daily progress below.

        <b>Sorry, but I won't be sharing pictures here until I manually verify each one of them by myself. This is due to privacy issues, so please wait a while!</b>

    <h2>January 30th: Day 1</h2>

    <p>
        Hello! Today was really exciting, since it was the first day of the long-awaited trip to Japan!<br>
        Fun fact: <b>this trip was actually delayed like three times.</b> I was supposed to go to Japan after the summer break, but I had to take lung cancer surgery, which canceled the trip.We were also thinking of going at the beginning of winter break, but it got delayed again.<br>
        I arrived at Incheon Airport at around 8AM, and quickly finished the inspection.<br>
        I also created a Discord group chat with some of my trusted friends to share pictures together and discuss about all the stuff that happenes in Japan.<br><br>

        After a 2-hour long airplane ride, we landed on <b>Kansai International Airport</b>! I was really excited to visit Japan, but also kind of nervous due to my social anxiety. Although I was somewhat decent at chatting in Japanese, I had pretty much never practiced listening or speaking in Japanese. 😭<br>
        Our first destination was <b>&Omacr;saka Castle (大阪城)</b>, so we had to ride the <b>Haruka line (はるか線)</b> and transfer into the <b>Tanimachi line (谷町線)</b>. I was surprised to see how the trains in Japan were so complex and straight-forward at the same time.<br>
        We took a look of the &Omacr;saka Castle from outside, because we didn't want to pay to get inside the actual castle. And do you know what the funny thing is? <b>I was actually kind of having fun speaking Japanese.</b> Sure, I made like a gazillion mistakes without noticing, but it was my first time in life I got to actually use Japanese! I was really happy to see those funny Japanese characters show up in irl haha<br>
        After all that, we were getting really hungry, <b>so we decided to eat 🍣 Sushi!</b> We found a random local shop, but it actually turned out to be really delicious. I also noticed how similar the landscapes were in Japan compared to Korea, they both had that charming countryside feeling (which I swear, is really hard to describe heh)<br>
        After the heavenly dinner, we bought some food in the nearest LAWSON, and decided to stay in our hotel for the rest of the day. Our hotel was located somewhere near <b>Namba (なんば)</b>, inside the <b>Sennichimae Shopping Street (千日前商店街)</b>. I was surprised to see how compact the hotel rooms were, but we had enough space to enjoy the stay. I spent the rest of the day eating the heavenly food from the convenience stores, and talking to people on Discord.

    <h2>January 31rd: Day 2</h2>

    <h1>I'm still writing the rest of the trip, please wait until I write everything!</h1>
