        <h1>Domain Registration Notice</h1>

        <h2>February 07th</h2>

        <p>
            <b>I have successfully registered a domain at <a href="https://lanzoor.dev">lanzoor.dev</a>!</b><br>
            For now, the SSL certificates are being generated, which means that <b>you won't see anything even if you visit the website, but rather a connection error.</b> This is intended.<br>
            I will connect the DNS with GitHub Pages tomorrow, but only if the SSL certificates have been generated.<br>
            <b>Thank you for your support!</b> I will be posting furthermore updates below.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>The SSL certificates finished building!</b> I will merge every previous website of mine into one large GitHub repository, and connect the DNS servers tomorrow, since it is way too late for me right now.
        </p>
