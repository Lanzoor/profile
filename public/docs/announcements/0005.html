    <h1>Domain Registration Notice</h1>

    <h2>February 07th</h2>

    <p>
        After about an hour of struggling, <b>I have successfully registered a domain at <a href="https://lanzoor.dev">lanzoor.dev</a>!</b><br>
        <b>The SSL certificates finished building in like 5 minutes after I started it.</b> I will merge every previous website of mine into one large GitHub repository, and connect it to a Vercel project and propagate the DNS changes tomorrow.<br>
        <b>Thank you for your support!</b> I will be posting furthermore updates below.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I have successfully managed to propagate the DNS record!</b><br>
        I only published a dummy page for now, but I am going to merge all repositories of mine into one ultimate repository and link it to the Vercel project.
    </p>

    <p>
        I merged every previous webpage of mine into an ultimate library, (<code>core</code>) polished the file structure and successfully updated the Vercel project! I will frequently make changes to the website, so have fun exploring! :D
