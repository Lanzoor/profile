    <h1>Domain Registration Notice</h1>

    <h2>February 07th</h2>

    <p>
        <b>I have successfully registered a domain at <a href="https://lanzoor.dev">lanzoor.dev</a>!</b><br>
        For now, the SSL certificates are being generated, which means that <b>you won't see anything even if you visit the website, but rather a connection error.</b> This is intended.<br>
        I will connect the DNS with GitHub Pages tomorrow, but only if the SSL certificates have been generated.<br>
        <b>Thank you for your support!</b> I will be posting furthermore updates below.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The SSL certificates finished building!</b> I will merge every previous website of mine into one large GitHub repository, and connect the DNS servers tomorrow, since it is way too late for me right now.
    </p>

    <h2>February 08th</h2>

    <p>
        At about 11am (GMT+9), I have successfully managed to connect the Vercel project via DNS routes to the domain!<br>
        I only published a blank, testing page for now, but I am going to merge all repositories of mine into one ultimate repository (<code>core</code>) and link it to the Vercel project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sad news. I combined all webpages of mine into the ultimate repository, but that means that I now don't need the previous repositories. So...<br><br>

        I had to delete all previous webpages of mine. 😭<br>
        Don't worry, though- I have lots of ideas on what content to add to the ultimate directory, and it will grow large in size really soon.
