    <h1>Retirement of the Old Profile Website</h1>

    <p>
        After about 4 months of using the somewhat empty profile website, <b>I have decided to make a new profile website!</b><br>
        Unlike the previous profile website, this new profile website is supposed to be more interactive and modern.<br>
        <b>I am also developing a responsive design, so that the website becomes more accessible for all devices.</b><br>
        Since <b>the new profile website is <i>incomplete</i> as of right now;</b> I have also made a backup of the old profile website, and published it to GitHub.<br>
        Thank you for your understanding!
    </p>
