    <h1><code>periodica</code> Retirement</h1>

    <p>
        After like months of no-one using the program, (why tho 😭) I have decided to <b>discontinue the <code>periodica</code> CLI/TUI project.</b><br>
        This was a really hard decision to make, since it was <i>genuinely fun</i> for me to build and manage the project,<br>
        and I still have lots of ideas for what amazing stuff I could implement for the CLI program!
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
        If you don't know, <code>periodica</code> was a periodic table CLI built using Python.<br>
        However, I hit some massive practical issues while creating the project, such as distribution, motivation and much more.<br>
        Also, since I was literally making the database by MYSELF, (yep. genius past self I know 🧠🧠🧠🧠) it was really impossible to manage it.<br>
        I really liked how the input turned out, though. It was a really good chance to learn about the full potential of Python! Just take a look at this!<br><br>

    <h2>Future Plans & Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        For now, the project has been archived; as time goes on, <b>it's going to eventually get deleted and no longer available.</b><br>
        <b>I DO NOT have any plans on continuing or saving the project at this position.</b><br>
        However, I may have some good news; in the near future, I <i>may</i> build a new similar periodic table CLI program.<br>
        Instead of hand-coding every aspect of the program, it will be <b>API-based</b>.<br>
        I'm kind of sad that I have to give up some amazing features for the program due to this change, though.<br>
        <b>I haven't found any API that satisfies me yet.</b> If you manage to find a data-rich periodic table database, please feel free to <a href="https://lanzoor.github.io/profile#connections" target="_blank">contact me</a> and let me know!<br><br>
