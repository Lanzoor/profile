    <h1>- Announcement removed by owner -</h1>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, <b>this announcement has been deleted by the owner.</b><br>
        This could be due to several reasons, including <b>content deemed insufficient / irrelevant, privacy, dismotivation</b> and more.<br>
        <i>Notice: even if an announcement is deleted, the IDs won't be shifted and it will still retain its position inside the system.<br> This is to ensure that the links to the other announcements won't break.</i><br><br>

        <b>Thank you for your understanding!</b>
    </p>

    <h2>We're sorry for the inconvenience.</h2>
