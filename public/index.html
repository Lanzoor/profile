                    <hr>

                    This website is for hosting my webpages, projects and servers, <b>so that it's accessible for everyone</b>. I wanted everyone to be able to access my projects and documents without having to spend their time installing or setting up something.

                    <hr>

                    My name is <code>lanzoor</code>, and I am a Korean individual who likes <b>programming, languages, science, gaming, and much more.</b><br>
                    Since it is really hard for me to describe myself in this short text, you should definitely check out <a href="/profile/index.html">my profile</a>!<br>

                    <h3>Is this website mobile-friendly?</h3>

                    <hr>

                    <b>Yes... at least I hope so.</b> I test this website on all of my devices pretty much every day, and I try to fix every issue I see as soon as possible. However, since I am not the master of devices and have every device in the world, I cannot make sure that the page behaves perfectly on all devices. <b>If you have issues on your device, please let me know by <a href="#connections">contacting me</a>!</b>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>How can I contribute to this website?</h3>

                    <hr>

                    <b>You can check the section in the <a href="/credits.html#how-to-contribute">credits page</a>!</b><br>
                    We also have guidelines for contribution, to make sure that the project is managed properly.<br>
                    For details, see the <a href="/guidelines/contribution.html">contribution guidelines</a>.

                    <b>This is most likely because the link to the required scripts was somehow broken.</b><br>
