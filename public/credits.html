        <h2 id="how-to-contribute">How to Contribute</h2>

        <p>
            First of all, please don't feel pressured to contribute anything to this website.<br>
            It's meant to be open and welcoming for anyone to visit, and your presence alone already means a lot.<br>
            <i>That saiddd,</i> <span class="dim">(insert dramatic pause here)</span> there are a few different ways you can support the site, all of which I value equally.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Sharing Your Thoughts</h3>

        <p>
            If you have any <b>suggestions, concerns, ideas, or issues</b>, <a href="/index.html#connections">getting in touch</a> is a wonderful way to contribute.<br>
            Feedback helps me improve and motivates me to keep building new features.
        </p>

        <h3>Joining Development</h3>

        <p>
            If you'd like to get hands-on, you can help by opening a <a href="https://github.com/Lanzoor/core/pulls">pull request</a>.<br>
            I'll carefully review changes, and <b>contributors may be recognized in the credits section</b> as a way of saying thanks.<br><br>

            <b>Please remember: this way of contributing should <i>never</i> be used with malice.</b>
            For details, see the <a href="/guidelines/contribution.html">contribution guidelines</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Simply Being Here</h3>

        <p>
            Visiting and exploring the site itself is a <i>very</i> meaningful contribution.<br>
            Your interest keeps the project alive, and I truly appreciate you spending time here.<br>
            <b>I update the site with passion almost every day, so you'll see it evolve over time.</b><br>
            Even though hosting has costs, the joy of creating and sharing easily outweighs them.<br>
            So please drop by whenever you like, and most importantly: <b>have a great day! 👋</b>
