        <h1>- JavaScript Loading Error -</h1>

        <p>
            This error has lots of unpredictable cases, so please read carefully!<br>
            <b>This page intentionally refrains from JavaScript script usage, in order to minimize issues.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Verify JavaScript is Enabled</h2>

        <p>
            Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.<br>
            If you previously disabled it through developer tools or browser settings, re-enable it and reload the page.<br>
            <b>Without JavaScript, interactive features will fail to function.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Clear Cache and Refresh</h2>

        <p>
            Sometimes cached versions of files can cause loading issues.<br>
            Clear your browser cache and reload the page to ensure you are loading the latest version of the scripts, or do a <b>Hard Refresh.</b> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>)
        </p>

        <h2>3. Check File Linking</h2>

        <p>
            Confirm that the script files are correctly linked in the HTML.
            Open your browser console and look for errors such as <b>MIME type mismatches</b> or <b>404 Not Found</b>. <br>
            These indicate that the file path may be incorrect or the server is not serving the file with the proper content type.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Contact Support</h2>

        <p>
            <b>The problems are most likely <i>not your fault</i> <span class="dim">(unless you manually edited some stuff which, don't do that btw!)</span>, so don't feel sad!</b><br>
            If the problem persists after following the steps above, please reach out and <a href="/index.html#connections">contact me</a> with details of the error message and console output. <br>

        </p>
