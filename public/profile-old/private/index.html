        <p>
            You found the secret! <i>Sort of.</i>
            <b>
                Just letting you know that this section contains some information about myself that I'd like to tell you, but also may discomfort some users.
            </b>
            I don't want others having to bother about this while talking to me, so please do not overhear anything I say here. Welp, here goes nothing...
        </p>

                It's difficult for me to say this publicly, but I think context matters for understanding who I am now.<br><br>

                <h2>- Eccentricity -</h2>

                Over the past years, I went through prolonged medical treatment for cancer (osteosarcoma), which forced me into both social and psychological isolation during a critical stage of my development. During that time, I had very limited opportunities to learn how to socialize naturally, and I later developed ADHD, OCD, social anxiety, and related difficulties.<br><br>

                I entered online spaces without having the experience or tools to navigate relationships properly. I often didn't understand boundaries, expectations, or how my behavior might be perceived. As a result, I made mistakes and decisions that I really regret. If my younger self affected anyone negatively, I want it to be clear that
                <b>those actions never reflected my true intentions or values.</b>
                They came from confusion and inexperience, not malice.<br><br>

                After a specific turning point, I made a deliberate effort to reflect, change, and take responsibility for my behavior. That process has been ongoing, and I continue to work on myself.

                <h2>- Obduracy -</h2>

                When I was very young, I lost the sight in my right eye due to retinoblastoma. Even though it happened early in my life, its effects didn't disappear with time. Growing up with a visible difference made me feel unlucky and separated from others, like I was always slightly out of place no matter where I was.<br>

                Because of that, I often struggle with motivation and self-worth. It's hard not to compare myself to others and feel like I started life with a disadvantage I never chose. On bad days, that frustration turns inward, and I end up hating parts of myself for something that was never my fault. Those feelings can be exhausting, and they sometimes make it difficult to stay confident or hopeful, even when I know logically that I shouldn't blame myself.

                <h2>- Individuality -</h2>

                Even after making changes and trying to address every possible issue, I have repeatedly experienced situations where new connections faded without explanation, or where I felt ignored or misunderstood by people I genuinely cared about. Those experiences left a lasting impact and continue to influence how I approach relationships today.<br><br>

                Because of this, I changed my texting style countless times, constantly questioning whether I lacked empathy or emotional awareness. At times, I even tried to change my personality, hoping it would make things easier. These patterns made me anxious, prone to overthinking interactions, or unintentionally withdrawn whenever I felt uncertain. I strongly dislike being judged, and I believe no one should have to endure the pain of being judged without explanation. The least I can do to prevent that kind of hurt is to treat everyone with equal sympathy, understanding, and care.<br><br>

                I often struggle with periods of intense mental overload, since I try to do way too much things at once. When that happens, my thoughts become scattered or shut down entirely, and things that once mattered to me (such as programming and even gaming) can feel distant, boring, or impossible to engage with. During my lowest moments, this has included passive thoughts about not wanting to exist or questioning whether continuing is worth it. I am actively working through this and seeking healthier ways to live. I really appreciate the small things in life, but they also tend to hurt me the most.<br><br>

                I'm not sharing this to ask for sympathy, forgiveness, or special treatment. I'm sharing it because this history shapes how I communicate and react, even when I'm trying my best. I value honesty, empathy, and growth, and I continue to work toward being better aligned with those values.<br><br>

                <b>Thank you for trying to understand the difficulties.</b> You really are the best! ♡
