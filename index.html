        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Hello there!</b> 👋<br>
            I go by the name of <b>Lanzoor</b>, but you can also call me <b>Lanzy</b>!<br>
            My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, and my Japanese name is 光星 蘭蒼瑠 (こうせい らんそうる) but you can still call me ランジョア.<br>
            I also have a few more aliases, but they are archaic and I don't regularly use them. (Lapis Lazuli, 光星 蘭蒼瑠 & 廃星 虚冥魂)<br>
            I live in <b>South Korea</b> 🇰🇷 (UTC+9, it is <code id="time_text">HH:MM:SS</code> in my time right now). I joined Discord on <b>October 7th, 2023</b>, and I am usually active on Discord most of the time. My MBTI is <b>INTP</b><br>
            Unfortunately, life decided to hate on me and I have ADHD and OCD. I also have severe social anxiety. My birthday is <b>November 2nd</b> 🎂<br>
            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🌐 <b>Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs.</b><br>
                I am already a polyglot, but I still want to experience lots of languages for my conlangs.<br>
                I can speak Korean and English pretty fluently, and can speak some Japanese and Chinese.<br>
                I'm also currently studying Dutch, and interested in studying Greek and German. Greek has the best writing system imo
            </li>
            <li>
                💻 <b>Making random programs and learning programming languages.</b><br>
                I usually work on Linux, but I do not want to force myself into lots of intense programming work. I usually just make documents (like this!) or make small utility programs.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in Python, because it suits the best for me. I am trying game development via <code>pygame</code> nowadays, but I also make interactive CLIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in JavaScript and TypeScript. I started programming by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of things about JavaScript.<br>
                However, I still need to improve at actual web development in JavaScript. Also, I know most of the TypeScript features.<br>
                I am currently learning how to write code in C and Rust. It's not in my priorities for now, but I still want to create more CLIs with them.<br>
                ...and there's the markup languages. I can write HTML, CSS, Markdown, and some LaTeX. But only if you consider them actual programming languages.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                🔬 <b>Studying science.</b><br>
                I like most sub-branches of science, and especially <b>🧪 chemistry, 🔭 astronomy, and ⚛️ physics.</b><br>
                It's not that I am very good at any of these, but I want to study them because it's genuinely fun for me. I especially love astronomy, because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                🎮 <b>Playing games, and having fun.</b><br>
                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                I don't really like <b>horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG games</b>, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I feel like it, or I am stressed out because of everything.<br>
                Recently however; I have been returning to programming again, so I don't play games all day unlike what I used to do before.<br>

            <li>
                🎧 <b>Listening to music, and playing instruments.</b><br>
                I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music. I mostly enjoy PJSK songs and vocaloid songs, but I sometimes listen to general J-Pop.<br>
                I also listen to some electronic music (like Camellia, Kobaryo, and the entirety of TANO*C) but only occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. (brings me a lot of nostalgia)<br>

                I used to be able to play the piano when I was young, but since I felt no motivation in doing it, I decided to play drums.<br>
                I am not really good at playing drums, but I try to play my favorite songs on the drum to entertain myself.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also have some other small interests. I like solving Rubik's cubes, and drawing anime. But I'd really like to try out other things as well!
            </li>

            That said, if you have any suggestions for any of my conlangs or my works, please DM the Discord user <code>lanzoor</code> or email <code>lanzoorgaming@gmail.com</code> and ask me about your inquiry!<br><br>
            Thanks for reading this to the end! I will add more stuff about myself later on, so please check here frequently, but only if you'd like :3
