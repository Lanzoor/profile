        <p>
            <b>Hello there!</b> 👋<br>

            I go by the name of <b>Lanzoor</b>, but you can also call me <b>Lanzy</b>! My Japanese name is
            <ruby>

            <ruby>
                蘭蒼瑠
                <rt>らんそうる</rt><rp>)</rp>
            </ruby> but you can still call me ランジョア.<br>
            My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, and I live in <b>South Korea</b> 🇰🇷! (UTC+9, it is <code id="time_text">HH:MM:SS</code> in my timezone, hover over for alternative format)<br>
            I joined Discord on <b>October 7th, 2023</b>, and I am usually active on Discord most of the time. My birthday is <b>November 2nd</b> 🎂<br>
            My MBTI is <span class="tooltip"><b>INTP</b><span class="tooltip-text">
        I - Introverted<br>
        N - Overthinks<br>
        T - Thinks before empathizing<br>
        P - Prefers the flow
    </span>
</span>! (hover for more information) However, due to some personal reasons, life decided to hate on me, and I have developed ADHD, OCD and social anxiety, which led to some, <a href="#private">specific incidents</a>.<br>
            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🌐 <b>Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs.</b><br>
                I want to study and experience lots of languages both for my conlangs and for fun.<br>
                I can speak Korean and English pretty fluently, and can speak some Japanese and Chinese.<br>
                I'm also currently studying Dutch, and interested in studying Greek and German.
            </li>
            <li>
                💻 <b>Making random programs and learning programming languages.</b><br>
                I usually work on Linux, but I do not want to force myself into lots of intense programming work. I usually just make documents (like this!) or make small utility programs.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in Python, because it suits the best for me. I am trying game development via <code>pygame</code> nowadays, but I also make interactive CLIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in JavaScript and TypeScript. I started programming by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of things about JavaScript, but I still suck at actual web development.<br>
                (...and there's the markup languages. I can write HTML, CSS, Markdown, and some LaTeX. But only if you consider them actual programming languages.)<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                🔬 <b>Studying science.</b><br>
                I like most sub-branches of science, and especially <b>🧪 chemistry, 🔭 astronomy, and ⚛️ physics.</b><br>
                I especially love astronomy, because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                🎮 <b>Playing games, and having fun.</b><br>
                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                I don't really like <b>horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG games</b>, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I feel like it, or I am stressed out because of everything.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                🎧 <b>Listening to music, and playing instruments.</b><br>
                I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music. I mostly enjoy PJSK songs and vocaloid songs, but I sometimes listen to general J-Pop.<br>
                I also listen to some electronic music (like Camellia, Kobaryo, and the entirety of TANO*C) but only occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. (brings me a lot of nostalgia)<br>
                I can also play the drum, but I'm not really that good at it.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also have some other small interests, such as solving Rubik's cubes, and drawing anime. But I'd really like to try out other things as well!
            </li>
        </ul>

            That said, if you have any suggestions for any of my conlangs or my works, please DM the Discord user <code>lanzoor</code> or email <code>lanzoorgaming@gmail.com</code> and ask me about your inquiry!<br><br>
            Thanks for reading this to the end! I will add more stuff about myself later on, so please check here frequently, but only if you'd like :3

        <p>Hey there! <b>This section contains some private information that I'd like to tell you, but also may discomfort some users.</b><br> I don't want others having to bother about this while talking to me. Please do not overhear anything I say here.</p>

        <blockquote id="private">
            <span class="hidden">( - Hover to reveal - )</span>
            <span class="revealed" hidden>
                It's difficult for me to say this publicly, but I think context matters for understanding who I am now.<br><br>

                Over the past years, I went through prolonged medical treatment for cancer, which forced me into both social and psychological isolation during a critical stage of my development. During that time, I had very limited opportunities to learn how to socialize naturally, and I later developed ADHD, OCD, social anxiety, and related difficulties.<br><br>

                I entered online spaces without having the experience or tools to navigate relationships properly. I often didn't understand boundaries, expectations, or how my behavior might be perceived. As a result, I made mistakes and decisions that I regret. If my younger self affected anyone negatively, I want it to be clear that <b>those actions never reflected my true intentions or values.</b> They came from confusion and inexperience, not malice.<br><br>

                After a specific turning point, I made a deliberate effort to reflect, change, and take responsibility for my behavior. That process has been ongoing, and I continue to work on myself.<br><br>

                Even after that, I've repeatedly experienced situations where connections faded without explanation, or where I felt ignored or misunderstood by people I genuinely cared about. Those experiences left a lasting impact, and they still influence how I approach relationships today. I can become anxious, overthink interactions, or withdraw unintentionally when I feel uncertain.<br><br>

                I'm not sharing this to ask for sympathy, forgiveness, or special treatment. I'm sharing it because this history shapes how I communicate and react, even when I'm trying my best. I value honesty, empathy, and growth, and I continue to work toward being better aligned with those values.<br><br>



                <b>Thank you for trying to understand the difficulties.</b> ♡
